        <p>Primebuild at one point was my life force, calling - recruiting everything slowly at once, <br>
        Now it seems to have been a little bit flattering to go around my local town with my se-<br>
        cond-hand suits pitching a new life and future 
        in construction without a single clue ab-<br>
        out how one was going to build it - I mean this is bigger 
        a glorified b2b ad agency.

        <p>2025 has been the year of re-evaluation, and I have come to the conclusion that science <br> and technology, in other words <em><a href="https://paulgraham.com/gh.html">earnest hacking</a></em>
    is my true calling.</p>
        <p>That said, I have decided to open-source all my Primebuild material for free public use, <br>
        including some of my sourced drawings, new-builds, and even my first campaign as a <br>novice back in the day.</p>
